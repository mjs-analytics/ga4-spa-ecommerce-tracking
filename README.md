üëã Hi! I'm Megan Simmons ‚Äî a business intelligence and marketing analytics professional with over a decade of experience designing full-funnel data solutions across web, CRM, and marketing ecosystems.

This project demonstrates how I implemented GA4 ecommerce tracking on a single-page application (SPA), resolving legacy script conflicts and restoring reliable event tracking through a two-phase approach: a **schema rebuild** and a **GTM-based interim workaround**.

## üìà Business Context

This project supported a high-traffic B2B ecommerce platform within the life sciences industry, where accurate product interaction and conversion tracking were essential for informing digital strategy, optimizing customer experience, and supporting high-value scientific transactions. Because the site was built as a single-page application (SPA), legacy analytics scripts failed to capture virtual page transitions and key ecommerce events‚Äîleading to **data loss, event duplication, and misalignment between spend and ROI**.

Maintaining accurate tracking across product views, checkout, and purchases was critical to support campaign optimization and budget allocation.

## üß© Tracking Challenges in SPAs

Traditional analytics scripts often fail on SPAs due to lack of full-page reloads. Key ecommerce events‚Äîlike `add_to_cart` or `purchase`‚Äîwere missed or misfired, and the GA4 ecommerce schema was corrupted by improperly structured `items` arrays.

Additionally, multiple legacy scripts (`analytics.js`, `gtag.js`) coexisted alongside GA4, compounding tracking conflicts.

---

## üõ† Final Solution: Schema Cleanup & Rebuild

To future-proof tracking and eliminate legacy conflicts, I led a full overhaul of the analytics implementation:

- ‚úÖ Removed Universal Analytics (`analytics.js`) and `gtag.js` scripts from all SPA routes  
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt the ecommerce dataLayer using GA4‚Äôs recommended Enhanced Ecommerce schema  
- ‚úÖ Aligned all events (`view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, `purchase`) to GA4 validation standards  
- ‚úÖ Tested and validated across GA4 DebugView and Chrome DevTools  

### üß† Why It Mattered
- Reduced event duplication and inflated revenue reporting  
- Enabled clean, real-time ecommerce insights across the full customer journey  
- Created a scalable tagging framework for future expansion, including support for advanced event types such as cross-category product comparisons, buyer intent signals, and gated content engagement

## üîß Short-Term Fix: GTM Workaround

Before the final code release, tracking had to be stabilized for a live campaign. I implemented a GTM-based workaround that:

- Parsed legacy data from `ecommerce.purchase.products`  
- Built a GA4-compliant `items` array using a Custom JS variable  
- Cleaned up price values (which were inflated by a factor of 1M)  
- Used Regex triggers to only fire tags when the schema was valid  
- Created a fallback event listener for manual `add_to_cart` schema correction  

This temporary patch preserved event integrity during the broken state and ensured data continuity for marketing analysis.

## ‚úÖ Outcome & Impact

- üîß Restored GA4 tracking stability within 48 hours using GTM-based workarounds  
- üßπ Fully deprecated legacy analytics scripts in the subsequent code release cycle  
- üéØ Reestablished trust in ecommerce event data, enabling more reliable attribution, funnel insights, and cross-functional reporting  
- üß± Built a scalable, future-proof GA4 tagging framework to support advanced analytics and customer journey visibility
